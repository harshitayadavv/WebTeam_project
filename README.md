This repository contains my work on redesigning the Gallery Page, Placement Stats Posters, and the Navbar for the IIIT Kota website. The objective is to enhance the user experience while keeping the visual theme professional and aligned with the overall aesthetics of the website.

**Features:**
- **Gallery Page**: Redesigned layout for better visual consistency.
- **Placement Stats Posters**: Two posters (1581x803 px) showcasing placement data.
- **Navbar Redesign**: A more user-friendly and visually appealing navigation bar (optional task).

All designs are created keeping professionalism and the existing theme of the website in mind.
